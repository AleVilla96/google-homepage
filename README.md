For anyone reading this: 
Hi, my name is Ale and this is my Google Homepage Project (Easy version, I'm currently working of the Difficult one)
Well, it was easy to put the logo and the searchbar into the page, but I struggled a lot (and I mean, A LOT) trying to center them. I couldn't figure out how to do it myself so I used Google. That gave me an idea of how I could center those items (the logo and searchbar), I used "margin-left" and "margin-top" to move them around the page. 
Then for the navigation bars (top and bottom) i used CSS Grid. It wasn't so difficult but it took its time. After that I wanted them to resemble the Google page a little more so I changed the font and sizes, and also made them dead links (I think it looks cool). I couldn't find a way to make the "Google apps" button look nice, so I named it "dash". 
Finally, I added the "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" buttons and styled them a little.
The page is rough and when you resize the window all the elements move and try to make themselves visible, but I think it is okay for a first project.
Any comment on how to improve my code is welcome.

Best, Ale.
